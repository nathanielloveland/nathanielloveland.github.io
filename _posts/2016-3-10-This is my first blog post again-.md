title: This is my first blog post again
---
Today I went to the store for lunch it was fun. I bought a homeless guy lunch
too. He was nice. Then I got some cheerios for a snack at work and came back to
figure out how Krista can easier design blogs without knowing markdown or html.
Here is my attempt at testing this one program called texts for mac and windows.
Seems good so far!

 

Here is a list of other things I want to do today:

-   have a cow

-   teach a dog how to bark

-   eat some shorts

-   have a ball

 

Now that I know what I want Im going to make a picture about it:

Hurray! This is much easier.

 

|   |   |   | cell |   |     |   |   |
|---|---|---|------|---|-----|---|---|
|   |   |   |      |   | row |   |   |
|   |   |   |      |   |     |   |   |

-   *is this another type of list?*

-   yes

-   i think so

-   bulleted
